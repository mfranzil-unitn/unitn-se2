# Exercises
Let's take 10 minutes to work on the following exercises. We do not expect you to finish both right now, so do as much as you can and leave the rest as homework. 

1. **Implement two-numbers.js**, verifying that the user provides the right number of parameters (2) and in the right format (numbers).

2. **Create a frequency table** from an input file containing on word per line. 
Example Input:
```shell
$ cat tags.txt
Dog 
Cat
Dog
Dog
```
Example output:
```shell
$ node freq.js tags.txt
 Tag     Frequency  
 Dog     3      
 Cat     1       
```

Tips: 
- Try to split the file contents by the newline character (\n)
- Use the readline module ([suggestions from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6156501/read-a-file-one-line-at-a-time-in-node-js))


3. **Random joke**: Implement a script *jokes.js* that returns a random joke from the *The Internet Chuck Norris database*. 
The documentation specifies:

```
// To get a random joke, invoke:
http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random

// If you want to change the name of "Chuck Norris", 
// specify the firstName and lastName parameters:
http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random?firstName=John&lastName=Doe

```

4. **Wiki pages**: Implement a script that given an input term, search for the (top 5) matching Wiki pages. For example:

```shell
$ node wikisearch.js "Albert Einstein"

Albert Einstein
Hans Albert Einstein
Outline of Albert Einstein
Albert Einstein's brain
Einstein family

```

The documentation of the Wikipedia API suggests the following call:
```
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&list=search&srsearch=Albert%20Einstein&format=json

```
which has the following output format. The elements to display are in the query.search array.
```json
{  
   "batchcomplete":"",
   "continue":{  
      "sroffset":10,
      "continue":"-||"
   },
   "query":{  
      "searchinfo":{  
         "totalhits":5166
      },
      "search":[  
         {  
            "ns":0,
            "title":"Albert Einstein"
         },
      ]
   }
}
```


## Challenge:
Can you create a service that tells Zlatan jokes? You can use a format similar to that of the Internet Chuck Norris Database. You can store your jokes in an array, in a file, or simply reuse the Chuck Norris Service.
